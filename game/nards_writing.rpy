    scene opening
    
    "You wake up to the persistent sound of the ship's alarm as you near your destination, your body still lethargic from the aftereeffects of cryosleep. After a three month trip, you now only need to wait twenty minutes as the single passenger transport pod approaches and docks with the research vessel that will be your new assignment."
    
    "The control panel has detected your eyes opening. A wave of information comes up on the screen, along with the offer to open the viewport. There are more red flashing status symbols than there should be. A loud thump and a tremor across the ship confirms that something is wrong."
    
    "The transport doesn't have weapons, or even much in the way of scanners, since interstellar trips are rarely interrupted. At a wave of your fingers the viewport opens."
    
    "The first thing you see is the planet, followed by the research vessel, hovering at the furthest possible gravitational orbit. Then, the bugs. You can't see where they're launching from, but they are fast and big in numbers. Some are attacking the research ship, quickly being blasted away by the ship's basic defences, although you can see it struggles not to be overwhelmed."
    
    "One has attached itself to your ship, and you can see it scraping at the surface of your pod, looking for weaknesses. You know these aliens; they're invasive parasites, and shouldn't be in this sector of space."
    
    "There's little you can do about that now, however. All you can do is hope the research vessel spots and rescues you. Another thump and tremor alerts you to a second alien landing on your pod."
